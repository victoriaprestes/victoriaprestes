I love statistics and math and I love tech, so i thought 'why not join both?' Itâ€™s fascinating to see how data can tell stories and help us figure things out.
Currently, I have a couple of projects you can check out, and Iâ€™m constantly evolving my skills to be able create more interesting stuff.

### About Me
* I love gaming; my favorite game ever is *Outer Wilds*, but you can mostly find me playing *Stardew Valley* every other day.  
* I also love books, films, art, astrophysicsâ€”I know, I'm a nerd. But isn't everyone nowadays?
