I love statistics and math and I love tech, so why not join both? Itâ€™s fascinating to see how data can tell stories and help us figure things out.
Currently, I have an [exploratory data analysis project](https://github.com/victoriaprestes/ifood-data-analyst-case) you can check out, and Iâ€™m constantly evolving my skills to be able create more interesting projects.

* I also enjoy reading, trying new cafes, watching films, and visiting museumsâ€”yep, I'm a nerd. But isn't everyone? I'm always open to discussing gaming, art, or dataâ€”feel free to reach out!
